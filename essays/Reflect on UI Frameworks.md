## Oxford Comma?

A Coding Framework is a library or standard which adds onto existing languages providing a new sense of organization and functionality.  Frameworks can redfine the process to create code which changes the coding experience as well as the product.  But often times, frameworks don't seek to make a product different then the code made without a framework.  So why make multiple ways to get to the same goal?  

## Ease

Now the biggest reason why most people look to dabble into frameworks is because of the simplification of common proccesses that frameworks provide.  If we look at Bootstrap 5 the main "gimmick" of the framework is that it heavily simplifies HTML and CSS by creating useful and thoughtful classes which provide CSS to elements as they are defined in the HTML template.  The first one that people are taught on is the nav-bar which.  In raw HTML and CSS a decent looking nav-bar is a mini project of its own for people new to the language but Bootstrap 5 simplifies it to a single entry in its tutorial.  Many other Bootstrap classes provide multiple lines of CSS customization from inputting a small number of characters in the class field which reduces amount of code which is great for quick development, troubleshooting, and scaling.  

## Consistency

A big part of the coding world is unity.  While the number of frameworks are vast, popularizing frameworks and making them wide spread is great for how cohesive web development is.  Raw HTML and CSS leaves many many different ways to code the same sets of websites.  Frameworks helps to reduce this by guiding encouraging developers to code in similar ways.  In terms of upkeep, having more developers all on the same page in terms of framework and standards will also improve efficiency in those worlds.  If left to their own devices HTML and CSS could become obscure and difficult to understand.  

## The Learning Curve

Some might argue that it isn't worth learning frameworks like Bootstrap 5.  But the thing is it will always be a worthwhile investment.  Learning Bootstrap 5 was a bit a learning curve which required me to change the way I thought about HTML and CSS.  Had I learned it earlier it would have been easier but old habits and practices were rooted in me.  Despite the effort of unlearning and learning new Bootstrap 5 frameworks, I would say that it was worth it.  It makes development much quicker and streamlined.  And, I personally adore not having to scroll or click back and forth between large CSS files.  It truly does reduce the repetitiveness of having to configure CSS fields which can be easily controlled by changing a couple characters.





In case you aren't already familiar, the Oxford comma is an English grammar notation in which a list of items in a sentence are all separated by commas.  Especially, the item after the conjunction such as and.  For example: I love Javascript, ESLInt, and VsCode.  The extra comma helps to solidify the list like nature and the equivalence of all elements.  There are many hilarious examples of the confusion that occurs when the Oxford comma is omitted.  For Example:

<p align="center">
  <img src="../img/Oxford Comma Example.png" alt="Oxford Comma Example">
</p>

This simple example from a website shows how while the reader is able to come to the correct conclusion about what is being said, having the Oxford Comma could have helped to prevent that and improve first read-through clarity.

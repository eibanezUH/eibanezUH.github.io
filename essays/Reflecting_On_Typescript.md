As a Typecript noob, it is a very interesting language as it is an add-on to another language but is very complex and has a high level of mastery to it.  I like that it adds robustness as well as customization and scaling as a formal feature that is well thought out.  The only caveat is that I do not have much significant programming experience in other languages to say whether or not Typescript is a good language.  Things such as processing times and memory usage are things that are a couple of steps below where I am comfortable with this language.  All the methods of this language feel good to use but how do they compare to what other languages have to offer? I am not too sure.

From a software engineering perspective, I think that bringing more to reinforce your coding as well as having the capacity to proactively program for scalability and flexibility is a great thing to have.  I value that software engineering pays great attention to things such as standards and doing things mindfully.  I think that with Typescript functionality carefully assigning types and creating functions with various additional features and tools is a great thing to have.  From my knowledge of Python and C/C++, these languages do have to some extent ways to control typing and inputs as well as special function behavior but not to the extent that Typescript does.  

I think that athletic software engineering is a good way to help supplement quick learning and acquisition of a programming language if the right materials and resources are provided.  The WODS are great but as a complete noob at the language, my main issues take the form of not knowing the exact syntax or methods required to implement a solution.  It is enjoyable, but I often have to rely on outside sources to be able to gather that information in the short time of the WOD unless I opt to just try again.  I think that it will work for me but more practice before each WOD will be needed.  With not knowing the exact topic of each of them, there is an implicit requirement to do research on a wide range of topics so that you can at least have knowledge of what is out there.  Then it would be much easier to find out how to implement it when the time comes during the actual WOD.

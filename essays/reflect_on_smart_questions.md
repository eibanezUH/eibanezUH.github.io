## Something Smart
Smart question are important so that the software engineering industry as a whole can improve.  Smart questions not only help to build highly useful and powerful sources of information but also help to reduce the number of dumb questions which do the exact opposite.  No smart questions foster repetitiveness and non-unique keystrokes which only reword things that have already been well enough explained or vetted out.

I'd argue that this is a smart question.  This question shows that research has been done and I'd argue that the complexity and topic of the question matches the forum that it is being posted.  And as a result we can see that we get good advice.

Personal anecdotes do make up good advice and I would say that it was encouraged by the proper asking of the question that we see.  Without having expressed and done prior research and effort and providing a well-asked question, the answer would have simply been to search it up yourself or read a book about it which is a very obvious answer.

## Something No So

For an example of a not so smart question look no further.

Although I am guilty of relying on stack overflow posts like this myself, anything that can be answered by simply searching up documentation is very troubling.  As the documentation was made with thoughtfulness and effort to help those, especially beginners, to do these sorts of tasks.

while the answer was well written and throurough, it is a repeated creation of the original documentation which is readily available as well.  A not so smart question gets a less than valueable answer.

##To Conclude

I think that if we were to decrease the number of not so smart questions, things would be pretty interesting.  While it might be slightly more intimidating for beginners to get into things such as programming, I think that it would help to foster people to be more courageous and thorough.  To ask questions can be scary but people would be able to find comfort that they at least asked a good question.

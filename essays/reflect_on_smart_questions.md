## Something Smart

Smart questions are important so that the software engineering industry as a whole can improve. Smart questions not only help build highly useful and powerful sources of information but also help reduce the number of dumb questions, which do the exact opposite. No smart questions foster repetitiveness and non-unique keystrokes, which only reword things that have already been well explained or vetted.

I'd argue that this is a smart question. This question shows that research has been done, and I'd argue that the complexity and topic of the question match the forum where it is being posted. As a result, we can see that we get good advice.

Personal anecdotes make up good advice, and I would say that they were encouraged by the proper asking of the question. Without expressing and doing prior research and effort, and providing a well-asked question, the answer would have simply been to "search it up yourself" or "read a book about it," which is a very obvious answer.

## Something Not So Smart

For an example of a not-so-smart question, look no further.

<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    <img width="400px" class="rounded" src="../img/Stupid Question.png">
</div>

Although I am guilty of relying on Stack Overflow posts like this myself, anything that can be answered by simply searching documentation is very troubling. Documentation is made with thoughtfulness and effort to help those, especially beginners, accomplish these sorts of tasks.

<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    <img width="400px" class="rounded" src="../img/Stupid Answer.png">
</div>

While the answer was well-written and thorough, it is a repeated creation of the original documentation, which is readily available. A not-so-smart question gets a less valuable answer.

## To Conclude

I think that if we were to decrease the number of not-so-smart questions, things would be pretty interesting. While it might be slightly more intimidating for beginners to get into programming, I think it would help foster people to be more courageous and thorough. Asking questions can be scary, but people would find comfort in knowing that they at least asked a good question.

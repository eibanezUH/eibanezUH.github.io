##What Even is it???

It was quite interesting the moment that our professor popped the question: what is software engineering? In order to encourage participation, he started to probe further by asking what separated it from things such as computer science and straight-up programming. And it really made us think: what was the difference?  What I now understand is that software engineering separates itself from other programming disciplines in the way that it approaches and solves problems. Now this is not to say that programmers and developers are going about solving problems without any consideration of outside factors, but for software engineering, the scope and the amount of detail are required. Certain Programming and development scenarios can afford to overlook certain factors as the end result can be deemed the only critical criteria but engineering must ALWAYS consider ethics and methods.

The other major part of software engineering is that it is within the job description to maintain.  According to our professor, nearly all of the current software engineering jobs are to maintain and upkeep existing code.  As much as people would like to think that they may get to create code for a unique application, there is little chance that it hasn't already been written.  Proper testing and making standards as well as accounting for things like platforms language and culture are things that software engineers must do.  It is simply the bare minimum of the discipline.

##My Takeaway

I would say that from my understanding of software engineering, it is a major cornerstone of the STEM and Technological sector.  While major advancements can come in the form of prototypes, theory, garage startups, and random discourse in unofficial forums, proper software engineering is something much more infallible.  I think that emphasis on upkeep and mindfulness of factors such as culture, language, and global standards, are things that are too important to forget and software engineering is that task that addresses them.  I hope to learn more about the methods and beliefs that set software engineers apart from mere programmers and developers and to internalize them within myself.  I hope that by doing so, I can become a more mindful and multifaceted thinker which can improve the quality of all work no matter what field it may be in.

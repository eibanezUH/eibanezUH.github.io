Team RoSE is a group of multi-disciplinary undegraduate students who design and build a rover to compete in the University Rover Challenge.  This challenge outlines many criteria and missions that the rover has to compete and we are tasked to build the a fully functioning rover from the ground up.  

Some of the tasks include autonomous navigation, soil and signs of life analysis, end affector manipulation, and other tasks that change from each year of the competition.  In URC 2024 our team qualified to compete in the inperson competition hosted in Utah.

Since the rover is a cumulative and iterative process, I have contributed to the Avionics and Ground Navigation Control subsytems.  In Avionics, I helped with the design and implemention of a 7s battery and with various electronics wiring tasks across the rover.  Currently, I am part of the GNC subsystem and my main task is to setup long distance wireless communication across 900 Mhz and 2.4 Ghz frequencies

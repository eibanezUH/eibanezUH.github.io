It was quite interesting the moment that our professor popped the question: what is software engineering? 

In order to encourage participation, he started to probe further by asking what separated it from things such as computer science and straight up programming?

And it really made us think: what was the difference?  What I now understand is that software engineering separates itself from other programming disciplines in the way that it approaches and solves problems.

Now its not to say that programmers and developers are going about solving problems without any consideration to outside factors, but for software engineering, the scope and the amount of detail is required. 

Certain Programming and development scenarios can afford to overlook certain factors as the end result can be deemed the only critical criteria.
